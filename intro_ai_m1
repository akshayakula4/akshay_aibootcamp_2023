## Intro:
Ai is made by humans & rely on human-curated data. it improve human abilities & automation is good
The goal is improving lives, not replacing people

AI: a technique which enables machines to mimic humans
ML: subset of ai technique which use statistical methods to enable machines to improve with experience
Deep Learning: subset of ML which make computation of multi-layer neural network feasible.

use cases:
automating routine admin tasks: data entry, document process, appointments & schedules
realtime personalized recommendations: enhance customer service & sales
analyzing data from IOT sensors to predict machine failures and optimize maintenance.
scanning & analyzing legal contracts, medical records to extarct key info.
generating drafts of content like reports emails and social media posts.

automate repettaive & low value work & focus on creativity, innovation & strategy

ai usecases: https://www.nocode.ai/use-cases-by-industry/

which is not an ai:
1.rules based system - human knowledge != machine intelligence. 
2.simple optimizatiom - linear prog. are not ai
3.data analysis - BI & reporting data is on its own data. its not ai
4.pre-programmed behavior - an agent acting via hardcoded rules lacks learning & generalization associated with ai
5.static predictions - they are for predections without adapting its not ai
