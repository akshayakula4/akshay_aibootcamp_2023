data source >data quality > data cleaning > data transformation > data splitting

data splitting is used to avoid overfitting. Overfitting is when a ML model fits its training data
too well and fails to reliably fit additional data. it helps model to generalize well to unknow or unseen data
its simple sub-step in ML model.
  
 training data - subset of data to train the model
 validation data - used to fine-tune model parameters & provide an unbiased evalutaion of model during training phase
 test data - used to test the model after it has been trained to evaluate performance

features & labels,
- model performance
- computational efficiency
- interpretability
- generalization

data integration -> data quality -> model training  -> feature eng. -> all features or selectedfeatures or final features.

->self service data consumption
-> multi-cloud integration
-> automated governance, protection & security.

Disadvantages: 
-> over feeding the data which impacts model performance.
